    question: "How do I know which service is right for me?",
    answer: "Great question! Each service serves different needs. If you're looking to share your story or grow your business, podcasting might be perfect. For personal development and skill-building, our education offerings are ideal. And if you're feeling stuck and need a transformative experience, our adventure treks provide space for breakthrough moments. Feel free to book a discovery call to discuss your specific goals."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer virtual options for workshops and coaching?",
    answer: "Absolutely! While we love in-person connections, we understand the need for flexibility. Most of our workshops and coaching sessions are available virtually, and we've designed them to be just as engaging and effective as our in-person offerings."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the adventure trek experiences?",
    answer: "Our adventure treks include all camping equipment, meals, professional guides, safety equipment, and structured reflection/growth activities. We handle all the logistics so you can focus on your journey. Each trek is limited to 8 participants to ensure a personalized experience."
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance do I need to book?",
    answer: "For workshops and coaching, we recommend booking 2-4 weeks in advance. Adventure treks typically book out 2-3 months ahead due to limited spots and seasonal considerations. Podcasting projects vary based on scopeâ€”we'll discuss timelines during your consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer payment plans?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer flexible payment options for most of our services. For larger packages like podcasting projects or adventure treks, we can arrange installment plans. Reach out to discuss what works best for your situation."
