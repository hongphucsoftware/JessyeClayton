Welcome to You Are The Compass—a space for authentic conversations about finding your direction in life.

I'm Jessye, and I'm so glad you're here. Whether you found me through the podcast, social media, or a friend's recommendation, you've landed in a community that believes in one fundamental truth: you already have everything you need to navigate your journey.

## Why "You Are The Compass"?

A compass doesn't tell you where to go—it shows you which direction you're facing. It's a tool for navigation, but the journey is entirely yours to make.

Too often, we look outside ourselves for direction. We seek the "right" path in other people's experiences, waiting for someone else to hand us our purpose or tell us which way to turn. But here's what I've learned through my own journey and countless conversations with others: the compass you need is already within you.

## What You'll Find Here

This space is for real conversations about the messiness and beauty of personal growth. Through the podcast, workshops, and adventure experiences, we'll explore:

- **Authentic stories** from people who've navigated major life transitions
- **Practical tools** for decision-making and personal development  
- **Honest discussions** about fear, uncertainty, and finding courage
- **Adventures** that challenge you to step outside your comfort zone

## The Journey Ahead

I don't have all the answers—no one does. But I believe deeply in the power of sharing stories, asking better questions, and supporting each other as we figure it out.

Your compass is unique to you. My job isn't to calibrate it—it's to help you remember how to trust it.

Thank you for being here. I can't wait to see where your journey takes you.

*With gratitude,*  
*Jessye*
