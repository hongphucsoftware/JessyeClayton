You are building a small business website for a Sydney startup founder named Jessye Clayton. The brand is “You Are The Compass”. The site should be clean, minimal, warm & approachable, and use green as the primary color.

Tech + Project Setup

Use Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

No external UI kits. Keep dependencies light.

Create a second Link-in-bio micro-page (Linktree-style) at /links.

Content-driven: store page content in Markdown under /content/** and basic site settings in /site.config.ts.

Include a simple /api/subscribe endpoint that accepts { email } and:

If MAILCHIMP_API_KEY and MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID env vars exist, post to Mailchimp.

Else, append to /data/subscribers.csv server-side (create the file if missing).

Provide README.md with setup, env vars, and content editing instructions.

Brand & Styling

Primary: green #2E7D32

Accents: light green #A5D6A7, dark charcoal #111827, off-white #F8FAFC

Font pair: Inter for UI/body, Playfair Display for headings.

Rounded corners, generous whitespace, subtle shadows; avoid heavy gradients.

Provide a slot to upload the provided logo and auto-scale it (SVG/PNG).
